I release the source of this watchface for all non-commerical projects for free without any attribution 
requirements (although it certainly would be nice). The assets (i.e. image files) are released unencumbered of any 
license for all purposes, both commercial and non-commercial. I retain commerical rights to the name and concept, 
but if substantially changed (i.e. more than 20% of the codebase is changed), I release commercial rights to the 
source with the requirement of clear attribution (e.g. in an help/about screen).
